This is a simple chef-solo deploy package.

I've followed the instructions precisely as per
http://opinionated-programmer.com/2011/06/chef-solo-tutorial-managing-a-single-server-with-chef/
for the initial commit, including the example default.rb recipe file.

- TARGET is for ssh, like user@host
- COOKBOOK is a path to a cookbook directory (containing metadata.* etc) or a tarball thereof.


Requirements

- can download from the internet.

What it does
